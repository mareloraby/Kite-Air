# Features

![Screen2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42250266/147373838-5bee99ef-403a-4db9-bf7a-c70b1c8f80f6.jpg)



Our web application offers a smooth process of reserving a flight by providing a user experience that fosters satisfiability, efficiency, learnability and visibility. Some examples of this is seen in choosing seats where the user gets to view all seats on the flight and choose seats accordingly. Furthermore, navigation is always reversible; the app allows the users to go back and change a previously made choice while making a reservation. We also allow for immediate feedback through sending emails right after a reservation is confirmed or canceled and throughout the website, the user is sent a confirmation message upon any action taken.

# How to Run

### Port Numbers
- Backend:
     - app.js runs on port `3000` 
     - authServer.js runs on port `4000`
- Frontend: 
    -  App.js runs on port `8000`

### Which files to run
_We are working on deploying the app on herokuapp and Netlify. In the meantime, you can follow these steps to run the app._

Open 3 terminals:

  a. In the first terminal run `cd src` and then `node app.js`

  b. In the second terminal run `cd src` then `authServer.js`

  c. In the third terminal run `cd src/client/src` then `npm start`

> Notes: a & b run the backend, while c runs the frontend.
> Anything inside the client directory is related to the frontend.

# Libraries
Initially, run `npm init` and `npm i` in the terminal to download all node modules and install some basic libraries.

 - cors
 - Body-parser
 - jsonwebtoken
 - stripe 
 - bcrypt

- try searching for a flight going from Cairo (code: CAI) to Canada (code: YYZ) with departure date 10/01/2022 and arrival date 22/01/2022, choose a departure and return flight, choose your seats and checkout with the dummy card number: 4242 4242 4242, expiry: 12/25, cvv: 123.

# Database
 To provide database access for Kite Air, we used mongoose (a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment).
 We have 3 models:
- User
- Flight
- Reservation
